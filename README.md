# API Clients

In this project, we'll enhance the solution to the Umbrella project by:

- Writing a class called `GmapsClient` to encapsulate the logic of working with the Google Maps API.
- Use the `Twilio::REST::Client` to send a text message.

## Solution

There is a solution in the file called `solution.rb`.

- You can run it to see how the program should behave:

    ```
    ruby solution.rb
    ```
- Try it out with some rainy locations — [you should be able to find some using this live radar](https://www.rainviewer.com/weather-radar-map-live.html).
- Don't peek at the solution until you've tried things yourself.
